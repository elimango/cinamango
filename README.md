# seremango - for your project, for your cinema.
root compiled project of a series for npr workflow-focused custom C4D plugins and assets.

## Including (roadmap; not limited to)

- Linked tracks:
  - Automatic or baked syncing of keyframes of one track to another:
    (i.e; 'pos.x' and 'pos.z' of an object would transform at the same rate, on the same keys.)
  - Isolate keyframes of a track dependent of a parent (or other) track's keys.
- Camera track baking to parent (or other) track's keys for space switching.
- Camera depth dependent detail preservation and loss of detail for shaders.
- Camera angle dependent mesh flattening (flatten node).
- Automatic  <a href="https://elimango.github.io/studio/assetry/nodes/info/curvature">curvature</a> shader rim on overlapping mesh silhouettes
- Anti-parallaxing geometry for small non-zero camera animation (using look-at operators).
- Separation of shader AOVs & objects into automatic render engine passes (takes system).
- Cleaner Standard/Physical node-space compatible baking (one click solution to bake shader AOVs -> texture).
- Export selected points or the inverted selection in the structure manager to comma separated value and/or nodes selection.
- Layer -> tag folders for vertical tag view.
